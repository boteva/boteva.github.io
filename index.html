                    <b>So, how do you program a computer for laughs?</b> “Humor is one of the most non-computational
                    things,” Misra says. In other words, there’s no formula for funny-ness. While you can learn how to
                    bake a cake or build a chair from a set of instructions, there’s no recipe for crafting a great
                    joke. But if we want to imbue our machines with wit, we need to find some kind of a recipe; after
                    all, computers are unflinching rule-followers. This is the great quagmire of computational humor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>To do this, you have to pick apart what makes a particular joke funny.</b> Then you need to
                        turn
                        your ideas into rules and codify them into algorithms. However, humor is kind of like
                        pornography …
                        you know it when you see it. A joke told by British comedian Lee Dawson exemplifies the
                        difficulties
                        of deconstructing jokes, according to Misra. It goes: “My mother-in-law fell down a wishing well
                        the
                        other day. I was surprised — I had no idea that they worked!” It’s not so easy to pick out why
                        this
                        joke works (and some mothers-in-law would argue it does not work at all). For starters, there’s
                        a
                        certain amount of societal context that goes with understanding why a mother-in-law going down a
                        well is funny. Does this mean that creating a joke-telling computer would require the uploading
                        and
                        analyzing of an entire culture’s worth of knowledge and experience?

                        <b>Some researchers have been experimenting with a different approach.</b> Abhinav Moudgil, a
                        graduate student at the International Institute for Information Technology in Hyderabad, India,
                        works primarily in the field of computer vision but explores his interest in computational humor
                        in
                        his spare time. Moudgil has been working with a recurrent neural network, a popular type of
                        statistical model. The distinction between neural networks and older, rule-based models could be
                        compared to the difference between showing and telling. With rule-based algorithms, most of the
                        legwork is done by the coders; they put in a great deal of labor and energy up-front, writing
                        specific directions for the program that tells it what to do. The system is highly constrained,
                        and
                        it produces a set of similarly structured jokes. The results are decent but closer to what kids
                        —
                        not adults — might find hilarious.

                        Here are two examples:

                        “What is the difference between a mute glove and a silent cat? One is a cute mitten and the
                        other is
                        a mute kitten.”
                        <br><br>
                        “What do you call a strange market? A bizarre bazaar.”</p>

                        <h1>Here’s the real danger that Facebook, Google and the other tech monopolies pose to our
                            society</h1>

                        <h3>Most people fear and loathe monopolies because they dominate their categories or markets and
                            squeeze out competition. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg of the threat they hold,
                            warns technology analyst Jamie Bartlett.</h3>

                        <b>Tech is just the latest vehicle for very rich people to use well-tested techniques of buying
                            political influence, monopolistic behavior and avoiding regulation.</b>The threat that tech
                        monopolies pose to democracies is about more than the prices they charge: it’s the concentration
                        of power, data and control over the public space — and their ability to wield this power over a
                        growing number of economic activities, especially in the infrastructure and technologies of the
                        future. The following companies operate as either monopolies or oligopolies in their respective
                        fields: Google, Facebook, Uber, Airbnb, Amazon, Twitter, Instagram, Spotify. Integrated into
                        everything, everywhere, their technology will blanket the world.</p>

                    <p>Perhaps the final stage in the rise of monopolies is when their economic power morphs into what
                        Marxists sometimes call “cultural hegemony.” That is, where domination can be achieved through
                        controlling the ideas and assumptions available to the public. The idea, associated with
                        philosopher and politician Antonio Gramsci and his criticism of capitalism, is worth considering
                        because there’s little doubt that a techno-utopian view of the world has infected society.</p>
