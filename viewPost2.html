                        <h3>Most people fear and loathe monopolies because they dominate their categories or markets and
                            squeeze out competition. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg of the threat they hold,
                            warns technology analyst Jamie Bartlett.</h3>

                    <p>
                        <b>Tech is just the latest vehicle for very rich people to use well-tested techniques of buying
                            political influence, monopolistic behavior and avoiding regulation.</b>The threat that tech
                        monopolies pose to democracies is about more than the prices they charge: it’s the concentration
                        of power, data and control over the public space — and their ability to wield this power over a
                        growing number of economic activities, especially in the infrastructure and technologies of the
                        future. The following companies operate as either monopolies or oligopolies in their respective
                        fields: Google, Facebook, Uber, Airbnb, Amazon, Twitter, Instagram, Spotify. Integrated into
                        everything, everywhere, their technology will blanket the world.</p>

                    <p>Perhaps the final stage in the rise of monopolies is when their economic power morphs into what
                        Marxists sometimes call “cultural hegemony.” That is, where domination can be achieved through
                        controlling the ideas and assumptions available to the public. The idea, associated with
                        philosopher and politician Antonio Gramsci and his criticism of capitalism, is worth considering
                        because there’s little doubt that a techno-utopian view of the world has infected society.</p>
                    <p>
                        <b>All technology encodes within it certain values and assumptions about how the world
                            works.</b> Gutenberg’s press was more than a mere printing machine — it popularized the
                        ideal of free information exchange. The telegraph system transformed people’s perceptions of
                        time and distance, while the radio helped invent the concept of a single shared nationality,
                        culture and language. The medium, remember, is the message. And the medium of digital
                        technology, as a sector, is now monopolizing the whole economy.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Total victory for the monopoly is not over economics or politics.</b> It’s over assumptions,
                        ideas and possible futures. Because when that happens, Big Tech won’t need to lobby or buy out
                        competitors. They will have so insinuated themselves in our lives and minds, that we won’t be
                        able to imagine a world without them.</p>
